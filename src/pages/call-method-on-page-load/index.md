## Lifecycle Hooks
- Brief description
- List them

## Using the Mounted Hook
- The main one you'll use
- Called once Vue has setup everything in the DOM
- Can safely do whatever you need to here

## Using the Created Hook
- Before the DOM is instantiated, but after reactivity is setup
- Less commonly used
- Can be used to fetch data since you don't need the DOM for that
