## I really need to rebuild this blog

### Why do I want to rebuild my blog?
- Built on Gatsby, and I want something written in Vue
- Learn and use Vue ecosystem
- Initial focus was on just publishing posts and getting some momentum

### My current setup
- Every blog can be split into 3 parts: blogging framework, CMS, hosting
- Gatsby + React
- Markdown for blog posts (no cms yet)
- Hosting on a static server

### My blog wish list
- Super easy to make changes and deploy from anywhere (including test branches)
- Write posts in Markdown with ability to add in Vue components (like MDX)
- Static generated site that bootstraps into a PWA

## Picking my tech stack

### The Contenders
- Vue CLI 3
- Nuxt
- Vuepress
- Gridsome

### Getting feedback from the community
- Poll on Twitter with 1148 votes
- Lots of really useful feedback on frameworks I knew about
- Learned about different frameworks I had no idea even existed

### What I learned from Twitter
- People love Gridsome, Nuxt, Vuepress, and the Vue CLI for building personal sites and blogs
- Gridsome hasn't had that much time to mature yet
- Nuxt is amazing, but is a little too complicated and probably overkill for most blogs
- Vuepress is simple and easy, and designed specifically for this use case. @bencodezen has an awesome blog template for this

## How will I decide which to use?
- Blogging framework is top priority for me right now. CMS and hosting I can revisit later on, probably switch to Netlify's free tier.
- Evaluate each of Gridsome, Nuxt, Vuepress, and Vue CLI for building a blog and report back here!
